            James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton
            initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[23]
            Java was originally designed for interactive television,
            but it was too advanced for the digital cable television
            industry at the time.[24] The language was initially called
            Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[25] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and
            application programmers would find familiar.

            Sun Microsystems released the
            first public implementation as Java 1.0 in
            1996.[27] It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere
            (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost
            run-times on popular platforms.
            Fairly secure and featuring configurable
            security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions.
            Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages,
            and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff
            to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification.[28] With the advent of Java 2
            (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 â€“ 1999),
            new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
            J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments,
            while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.
